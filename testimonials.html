     <h2>A partners perspective:</h2>
     <p>
      <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
      When my partner said she was keen to explore 'HypnoBirthing' as
      part of our birth plans I was initially very sceptical of the term.
      I quickly discovered though this has little to do with hypnotism
      and far more to do with relaxation, comfort and feeling happy and
      prepared for the big day.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ania took us through informal but focused sessions that quickly
      dispensed with the preoccupation of 'controlling everything in advance',
      and instead helped us enjoy the changes taking place leading up to
      our new arrival.
      Little D and Mum are well, and looking back the sessions with Ania
      were a relaxed few hours of feeling together at a really busy time.
      Quite a few of the phrases and techniques are pretty helpful
      during early morning nappy changes too!

     <h2>I completely trusted my body:</h2>
     <p>
      <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
      I still can't thank you enough for how beneficial your sessions
      were for me, I went from being terrified to completely trusting my
      body and just knowing everything would be perfect if I kept my
      brain out of the way!
     </p>
     <p>
      In the end labour was a 4 hour power house of a delivery. As soon 
      as contractions started I climbed into bed and put on the Rainbow Relaxation 
      and did everything I could to just relax and get some rest. 
      Contractions quickly ramped up and B put the tens machine on my back, 
      I tried a bath but after two contractions in the bath and a 
      "I'm not sure I can do this" moment B decided it was time to go to hospital!
     </p>
     <p>
      We arrived and because I was breathing and just staying in my own
      place we were left in triage.
      I was too far in my own zone to really speak. 
      So after 30 mins of entering hospital I turned to B and promptly
      announced that "baby's here"!
      To which he didn't believe me, but by that point I was holding her head!
      So B delivered his little girl.
     </p>
     <p>
      So labour was great and I have a gorgeous healthy little girl.
      I can't thank you enough for getting me in the right head space to
      allow a quick and easy birth.
      I recommend hypnobirthing courses to everyone now!

     <h2>So quick that it actually took the staff by surprise:</h2>
     <p>
      <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
      As promised, here are some pictures of our baby Daughter, A.
      She was born 2 weeks early last Friday at 1.41am, weighing 3.1kg.
      We are back home and she is doing great!
     </p>
     <p>
      The labour was nothing like we had expected and planned for
      unfortunately as I had to be induced as an emergency due to
      pre-eclampsia that they discovered at my 38 weeks routine check.
      I went in hospital last Tuesday and was induced on Thursday so I
      didn't get the birth centre and had to give birth in the labour
      ward and delivery room instead.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the labour itself was very quick lasting a total of 6
      hours from 1cm dilated to actually giving birth! And 12hrs in total
      from the first contractions.
      It was so quick and so unexpected actually that it took the staff
      at Queen Charlotte by surprise and I ended up doing my entire
      labour with no pain relief beyond gas and air and a birthing ball&hellip;
      And I also got to experiment hypnobirthing techniques on the labour
      ward. Despite the conditions being opposite to our birth preferences,
      I was able to go through the whole process with no pain relief and
      completely naturally and have an entirely natural birth purely by
      using the breathing techniques you had showed me as well as the
      relaxation techniques and affirmations in my head!
     </p>
     <p>
      So I wanted to say a huge thank you again! I couldn't have done it
      in these conditions without our sessions before, they proved really
      helpful and got me through it all, especially the breathing which
      was brilliant and really worked for me!
      I was also able to shut away everyone else and the noise in the
      ward and deeply relax thanks to all our exercises and preparations.
      It was really helpful and absolutely worked for me!
      I also absolutely fell in love with the birthing ball which caused
      my water to break naturally.
      They tried to get me to lie on a bed several times to monitor me
      better but I refused and stuck to the ball until I was ready to
      push&hellip; Best decision I've ever made! :-)
     </p>
     <p>
      All in all, I somewhat strangely loved my birthing experience, came
      out feeling really empowered and proud of myself and had a great
      experience despite everything and our healthy baby girl is a
      reminder of it too.
     </p>
     <p>
      P and I wanted to say a big thank you for the great sessions we
      had with you, which played such a key role in my ️️️️labour.
      We have become strong advocates of hypnobirthing.
      It really works and really helps, no matter the circumstances!

     <h2>HypnoBirthing with twins:</h2>
     <p>
      <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
      After a brilliant natural birth with my first baby I wasn't sure
      what hypnobirthing would add to my birth experience but I couldn't
      have been more wrong.
      This time things were a bit more complicated &mdash; it was twins!
     </p>
     <p>
      The hypnobirthing course with Ania was brilliant. 
      She was very thoughtful in her approach and always tailored
      everything to our specific needs.
      My husband was very sceptical but even he felt that the course was
      completely accessible and he never felt alienated.
      I was hoping for another natural birth but twin one was a footling
      breech and I was feeling sad that I wouldn't get to use my new-found
      skills, so I was overjoyed when I went in to labour naturally.
      There was a long waiting list for the theatre and I got to use all
      the hypnobirthing techniques Ania had taught me going from 0-10cm
      in record time with an absolute minimum of pain and a feeling of
      complete control.
      It was a revelation. 
      When I was finally rushed in for my unavoidable caesarian the
      theatre staff were in amazement at my demeanour.
     </p>
     <p>
      I cannot speak highly enough of the whole experience.
      If you're in any doubt just do it!
