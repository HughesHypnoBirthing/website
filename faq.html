    <h1>Common Questions</h1>
    <h2>When is the best time to start?</h2>
    <p>
     It is recommended to start the course between 25 and 32 weeks
     pregnant as this gives plenty of time to learn and practice all the
     techniques.
     If you are closer to term arrangements can be made to suit your
     needs in the given time, just contact me for details.
    </p>

    <h2>My partner isn't convinced, can I do the course on my own?</h2>
    <p>
     HypnoBirthing believes that birth is about the mother, birth
     companion and baby.
     This means it is important you attend the course with a birth
     companion but this does not necessarily mean your partner.
     This could be your mother, friend or doula.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are unsure whether the course is right for you then the first
     session you book is with no obligation, covered by a small deposit.
     If after the first session you don't feel it is right for you then
     there is no obligation to continue.
     If you do wish to go on to complete the course then you then pay the
     remaining balance and book the sessions at a time to suit you.
    </p>

    <h2>Will I be hypnotized?</h2>
    <p>
     There are many misconceptions surrounding hypnosis.
     At one time or another we have all been in a state of hypnosis; if
     you are completely focussed on a tv programme or on a run and end
     up "in the zone" <b>this is a form of hypnosis</b>.
     During hypnosis you remain in control and aware of your surroundings
     but are able to tune out distractions.
     In HypnoBirthing we use hypnosis as a method of relaxation to help a
     woman follow the lead of her birthing body.
    </p>

    <h2>How many sessions are there? How long are they?</h2>
    <p>
     The course consists of five HypnoBirthing sessions. I like to schedule two and a
     half hours for each class.
     This gives ample time to discuss all the material and practice all
     the techniques taught.
     Sessions can vary in length according to your needs but they will
     not run over the allocated time, as this can be tiring for expectant
     mothers.
     The sixth optional session is a HypnoMothering session which is just for the mother to be.
    </p>

    <h2>I'm not far off my due date, is it too late to do the course?</h2>
    <p>
     If you are closer to term then arrangements can be made to suit your
     needs in the given time, please just contact me for details.
    </p>

    <h2>I heard HypnoBirthing means birth will be pain free, is that true?</h2>
    <p>
     HypnoBirthing believes that birth is a normal physiological
     function and not a medical event.
     The course teaches various methods to relax in labour to work in
     harmony with your body as it births.
     We learn how the techniques can free us from the Fear-Tension-Pain cycle.
     As a result many HypnoBirthing mothers require less, if any,
     medical intervention in the form of pain relief.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one can promise birth outcomes.
     However HypnoBirthing teaches you to approach birth in a calm
     manner so that you can look forward to the joyous event your
     birthing day will be.
