     <h3>What is HypnoBirthing?</h3>
     <p>
      HypnoBirthing believes that every woman has the right to a calm,
      easy and comfortable birthing experience.
      This should be a given.
     </p>
     <p>
      This course helps mothers to be and their birth partners achieve this
      through education about the birthing body, learning breathing techniques,
      the practice of relaxation with hypnosis and visualisations.
      Through knowledge and practice HypnoBirthing can help restore the
      birthing experience to the normal, joyous physiological event nature
      always intended it to be, with a mother that feels confident and
      empowered and can look forward to her birthing day.
     </p>
     <h3>Who developed the HypnoBirthing Method?</h3>
     <p>
      Established by Marie Mongan, founder of the HypnoBirthing
      Institute, the programme originated in the United States almost twenty years ago.
      It is now taught in many countries worldwide and has been used by many
      thousands of parents to achieve calm and comfortable birthing experiences.
      This is the only standardised and evidence based HypnoBirthing programme.
      For more information about the history of the programme see
      <a href="http://www.hypnobirthing-uk.com/">hypnobirthing-uk.com</a></p>
     <h3>What are the benefits of HypnoBirthing?</h3>
     <ul class="listcontent">
      <li>Mothers to be learn how to achieve deep levels of relaxation which helps eliminate the fear that causes tension and in turn pain</li>
      <li>Reduces stress in the mother which in turn keeps the baby well oxygenated during labour and birth</li>
      <li>Greatly reduces and often eliminates the need for painkillers and drugs </li>
      <li>Gives the birthing companion an integral role in the birth process</li>
      <li>Reduces the need for episiotomy and the likelihood of tearing</li>
      <li>Empowers parents with techniques to achieve a calmer, more gentle birth</li>

     <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="img/mothering.jpg" alt="" /></a>

     <h3>What is HypnoMothering?</h3>
     <p>
      HypnoMothering is a 2 &frac12; hour class for mums to be, new mothers, and
      mums of young children.
      Developed by two hypnotherapists (each a mother of twins) this fun
      and practical class teaches mothers easy and fast self-hypnosis techniques.
      This allows you to make the most of limited sleep, to keep calm and
      balanced on challenging days, and find focus and mindfulness amidst
      the myriad of feelings that mothers face.
     </p>

       <em>Connection to Baby:</em> Hypnosis helps a mother tune in to her
       baby and her own natural instincts.

     </header>
     <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="img/ania-hughes.jpg" alt="" /></a>
     <p>
      First and foremost I am a HypnoBirthing mother.
      HypnoBirthing taught me techniques which enabled me to enjoy the
      calm and comfortable birth I had hoped for.
      It inspired me to train as a Practitioner so that other mothers can
      also look forward to and enjoy their birthing day.
     </p>
     <p>
      With a BSc(Hons) in Psychology and having worked at Kings College London
      in a research role for a number of years
      the influence of the mind on the body seemed to be clear.
      This link seemed a logical extension in HypnoBirthing -
      where we learn to relax and trust our body to birth our baby
      through education about the birthing body and how to work with it.
      We can then approach birthing positively and embrace the experience
      as the normal physiological function it is, not a medical event.
      HypnoBirthing - The Marie Mongan Method is also the only course
      delivered in a standardised manner.
      This is done to ensure Practitioners like myself maintain high standards of
      delivery of the course material and to be able to gather data
      for this to be an evidence-based approach.
     </p>
     <p>
      I have also trained as the first HypnoMothering Practitioner
      in London.
      The early days into motherhood can be incredibly joyous but equally
      challenging as you find your feet as a new mother.
      I feel this class is a good bridge between preparing women for
      labour and the beginning of life as a mother.
      This class combines useful relaxation techniques with practical
      considerations of becoming a new mum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Having spent years working with children in a school setting
      I am fascinated by the way we as humans learn.
      Through life we never stop learning and I believe antenatal
      education is vital to a positive birth experience.
      Through gaining understanding of the birthing body and how to work
      with it, the relaxation techniques taught as part of the course mean
      that both mothers and birth partners are more empowered to enjoy
      their birthing journey, whichever way it takes them.

      <h3>A partners perspective:</h3>
      <p>
       <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
       When my partner said she was keen to explore 'HypnoBirthing' as
       part of our birth plans I was initially very sceptical of the term.
       I quickly discovered though this has little to do with hypnotism
       and far more to do with relaxation, comfort and feeling happy and
       prepared for the big day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ania took us through informal but focused sessions that quickly
       dispensed with the preoccupation of 'controlling everything in advance',
       and instead helped us enjoy the changes taking place leading up to
       our new arrival.
       Little D and Mum are well, and looking back the sessions with Ania
       were a relaxed few hours of feeling together at a really busy time.
       Quite a few of the phrases and techniques are pretty helpful
       during early morning nappy changes too!

      <h3>I completely trusted my body:</h3>
      <p>
       <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
       I still can't thank you enough for how beneficial your sessions
       were for me, I went from being terrified to completely trusting my
       body and just knowing everything would be perfect if I kept my
       brain out of the way!
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end labour was a 4 hour power house of a delivery. As soon
       as contractions started I climbed into bed and put on the Rainbow Relaxation
       and did everything I could to just relax and get some rest.
       Contractions quickly ramped up and B put the tens machine on my back,
       I tried a bath but after two contractions in the bath and a
       "I'm not sure I can do this" moment B decided it was time to go to hospital!
      </p>
      <p>
       We arrived and because I was breathing and just staying in my own
       place we were left in triage.
       I was too far in my own zone to really speak.
       So after 30 mins of entering hospital I turned to B and promptly
       announced that "baby's here"!
       To which he didn't believe me, but by that point I was holding her head!
       So B delivered his little girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       So labour was great and I have a gorgeous healthy little girl.
       I can't thank you enough for getting me in the right head space to
       allow a quick and easy birth.
       I recommend hypnobirthing courses to everyone now!

      <h3>So quick that it actually took the staff by surprise:</h3>
      <p>
       <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
       As promised, here are some pictures of our baby Daughter, A.
       She was born 2 weeks early last Friday at 1.41am, weighing 3.1kg.
       We are back home and she is doing great!
      </p>
      <p>
       The labour was nothing like we had expected and planned for
       unfortunately as I had to be induced as an emergency due to
       pre-eclampsia that they discovered at my 38 weeks routine check.
       I went in hospital last Tuesday and was induced on Thursday so I
       didn't get the birth centre and had to give birth in the labour
       ward and delivery room instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the labour itself was very quick lasting a total of 6
       hours from 1cm dilated to actually giving birth! And 12hrs in total
       from the first contractions.
       It was so quick and so unexpected actually that it took the staff
       at Queen Charlotte by surprise and I ended up doing my entire
       labour with no pain relief beyond gas and air and a birthing ball&hellip;
       And I also got to experiment hypnobirthing techniques on the labour
       ward. Despite the conditions being opposite to our birth preferences,
       I was able to go through the whole process with no pain relief and
       completely naturally and have an entirely natural birth purely by
       using the breathing techniques you had showed me as well as the
       relaxation techniques and affirmations in my head!
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wanted to say a huge thank you again! I couldn't have done it
       in these conditions without our sessions before, they proved really
       helpful and got me through it all, especially the breathing which
       was brilliant and really worked for me!
       I was also able to shut away everyone else and the noise in the
       ward and deeply relax thanks to all our exercises and preparations.
       It was really helpful and absolutely worked for me!
       I also absolutely fell in love with the birthing ball which caused
       my water to break naturally.
       They tried to get me to lie on a bed several times to monitor me
       better but I refused and stuck to the ball until I was ready to
       push&hellip; Best decision I've ever made! :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, I somewhat strangely loved my birthing experience, came
       out feeling really empowered and proud of myself and had a great
       experience despite everything and our healthy baby girl is a
       reminder of it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       P and I wanted to say a big thank you for the great sessions we
       had with you, which played such a key role in my ️️️️labour.
       We have become strong advocates of hypnobirthing.
       It really works and really helps, no matter the circumstances!

      <h3>HypnoBirthing with twins:</h3>
      <p>
       <img src="img/quote-top.png" alt="quote-bottom" width="22" height="15" />
       After a brilliant natural birth with my first baby I wasn't sure
       what hypnobirthing would add to my birth experience but I couldn't
       have been more wrong.
       This time things were a bit more complicated &mdash; it was twins!
      </p>
      <p>
       The hypnobirthing course with Ania was brilliant.
       She was very thoughtful in her approach and always tailored
       everything to our specific needs.
       My husband was very sceptical but even he felt that the course was
       completely accessible and he never felt alienated.
       I was hoping for another natural birth but twin one was a footling
       breech and I was feeling sad that I wouldn't get to use my new-found
       skills, so I was overjoyed when I went in to labour naturally.
       There was a long waiting list for the theatre and I got to use all
       the hypnobirthing techniques Ania had taught me going from 0-10cm
       in record time with an absolute minimum of pain and a feeling of
       complete control.
       It was a revelation.
       When I was finally rushed in for my unavoidable caesarian the
       theatre staff were in amazement at my demeanour.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot speak highly enough of the whole experience.
       If you're in any doubt just do it!

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
     </header>

     <h3>When is the best time to start?</h3>
     <p>
      It is recommended to start the course between 25 and 32 weeks
      pregnant as this gives plenty of time to learn and practice all the
      techniques.
      If you are closer to term arrangements can be made to suit your
      needs in the given time, just contact me for details.
     </p>

     <h3>My partner isn't convinced, can I do the course on my own?</h3>
     <p>
      HypnoBirthing believes that birth is about the mother, birth
      companion and baby.
      This means it is important you attend the course with a birth
      companion but this does not necessarily mean your partner.
      This could be your mother, friend or doula.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are unsure whether the course is right for you then the first
      session you book is with no obligation, covered by a small deposit.
      If after the first session you don't feel it is right for you then
      there is no obligation to continue.
      If you do wish to go on to complete the course then you then pay the
      remaining balance and book the sessions at a time to suit you.
     </p>

     <h3>Will I be hypnotized?</h3>
     <p>
      There are many misconceptions surrounding hypnosis.
      At one time or another we have all been in a state of hypnosis; if
      you are completely focussed on a tv programme or on a run and end
      up "in the zone" <b>this is a form of hypnosis</b>.
      During hypnosis you remain in control and aware of your surroundings
      but are able to tune out distractions.
      In HypnoBirthing we use hypnosis as a method of relaxation to help a
      woman follow the lead of her birthing body.
     </p>

     <h3>How many sessions are there? How long are they?</h3>
     <p>
      The course consists of five HypnoBirthing sessions. I like to schedule two and a
      half hours for each class.
      This gives ample time to discuss all the material and practice all
      the techniques taught.
      Sessions can vary in length according to your needs but they will
      not run over the allocated time, as this can be tiring for expectant
      mothers.
      The sixth optional session is a HypnoMothering session which is just for the mother to be.

     <h3>I'm not far off my due date, is it too late to do the course?</h3>
     <p>
      If you are closer to term then arrangements can be made to suit your
      needs in the given time, please just contact me for details.

     <h3>I heard HypnoBirthing means birth will be pain free, is that true?</h3>
     <p>
      HypnoBirthing believes that birth is a normal physiological
      function and not a medical event.
      The course teaches various methods to relax in labour to work in
      harmony with your body as it births.
      We learn how the techniques can free us from the Fear-Tension-Pain cycle.
      As a result many HypnoBirthing mothers require less, if any,
      medical intervention in the form of pain relief.
     </p>
     <p>
      No one can promise birth outcomes.
      However HypnoBirthing teaches you to approach birth in a calm
      manner so that you can look forward to the joyous event your
      birthing day will be.
